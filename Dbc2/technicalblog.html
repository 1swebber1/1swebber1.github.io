	<h3>Snowboarding.transworld.net</h3>

<p> Although the content of this site is primarily its main draw; its layout is pretty swell as well. This snowboarding website has a variety of material on the sport, ranging from upcoming product releases, places to get your summer snowboarding on, and videos to fuel your snowboarding needs. Visually the website is relatively cluttered but its use of white space allows for a high level of contrast which is very pleasing to the eye.  Accessing content on the homepage is relatively easy, along with the ability to surf from page to page. The websites content leaves the visitor eager and ready to get on a snowboard; makes you want to get off your computer and go do something. Its content is ultimately exciting and is a major reason for it landing on one of my top sites. </p>

	<h3>Soundcloud</h3>

<p>Soundcloud is another website which has gained my attention due to its content; music. Streaming from soundcloud is very easy and you are able to access your soundcloud library from practically any computer device. Its layout is fairly simple which allows for the user to easily access music that they liked, reposted, and even uploaded via their account. The best part though is that you can almost half the time download some great free music off of it: legally. Where the website lacks however is in its streaming consistency. Sometimes not all streams work as fast as they should nor is the quality of the music that iss uploaded at a high level. But despite these little negatives the website works very well and is a great way to access a large variety of music along with being able to connect with artists. </p>

<h3>The Onion</h3>

<p>Just like the other two sites easily accessible multimedia content, however all of the content posted is satirical news, it’s quite funny and definitely passes the time. The overall design isn’t anything special and their cluttered use of type makes it difficult to take on all of their hilarious content. After spending several minutes on the site, viewers are left happier then when they first reached the site. It at times makes your day that much more tolerable on the train.
