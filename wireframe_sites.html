			<h1>Soundcloud</h1>
			<p>Soundcloud's homepage is easy to navigate and allows for the user to quickly access newly uploaded music streams. The user may access their friends' and followers' posts and playlists while also being able to access uploaded mucis by artists you like. The content is a little cluttered and all stacked at each other; which isn't very attractive. The content of the site is easy to access but the layout is a little too cluttered and, I think, could get rid of a few things. Though the layout isn't attractive, it is easy to fine new artisits and possiby new music that you may find intriguing.
