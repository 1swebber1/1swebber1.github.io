<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>A blog can be defined as a personal website or webpage where one discloses their individual 
	opinion on various subject matters, updated on a regular basis. Although I'm not one who is entirely for blogging, blogs are a great opportunity for people to share their thoughts. The allow for shy and quiet poeple to come out of their shell and communicate with the world, whether it be postive or negative inout, they too now have a voice. Other than that I don;t see much use for it. I don;t care about poeple opinions on everything therefore I tend not to read them. That's not to say their opinion on a certain matter shouldnt be credited or doesn;t matter it just simply does not interest me. Which leads me to my take on the whole blogging thing throughout this process. I'm not going to lie, I was not a fan. I'm not one to blog or constantly update poeple on what I'm thinking. My thoughts are my thoughts for a reason and I don't feel the necessity to share them, especially on the internet. With that being said I;m not a hateful person nor do I despise them, if you want to blog go head booboo and do your thing, just don't expect me to be a big follower; unless of course the blog is about sneakers or snowboarding. Ultimately blogging is a very useful tool to many and in some ways opens doorways for great conversation but I'd rather be outside.</p>
