<h3>SQL Injection</h3>

<p>SQL injection is a programming technique in which a hacker creates new or modifies SQL commands. The injection is due to a software vulnerability that happens when a user enters data and sends it to an SQL interpreter as part of the actual SQL query. These commands are then carried out by a web application, which exposes important data pertaining to the hacked database. SQL injection allows for a hacker to create, read, alter, delete, and update data stored within the database. In its most popular form SQL injection leads to the theft of credit card numbers, social security numbers and other crucial financial data. It usually happens when a user is asked for input and rather than providing the correct information for the input, the user provides an SQL statement that will run on your database. 
</p>

<h4>Ways to Prevent SQL Injection</h4>

<p>SQL injection can be prevented in a few ways. One way to do so is by requiring input validation. The input validation will authenticate said input through various defined rules such as input length, syntax and type. Also when creating a database you should always make sure that the user has as minimal privileges as possible so that they are not to have access to an administrator account. Also you can encode the database making it safer for a user to input data. Another minor step that can be taken towards injection prevention is removing all stored procedures that are not being used. That way no one can access them unknowingly, allowing them to hack the database.
