<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>

<p>“Stereotype Threat” is a theory that defines “the underperformance of a minority group due to the anxiety of their social identity.” Claude M. Steele explains in his lecture that minority groups or individuals with a minority identity will underperform in academic situations where they feel anxious due to prejudice. 

Being a white male, I don’t feel as though I have ever been attacked due to my identity there have definitely been times where I felt anxious or threatened due to my social identity. Probably the most vivid memory I have of it stems from my speech impediment I once had as a child. In middle school I had trouble with enunciating my r’s and w’s, making rabbit sound like wabbit and world sound like rorld. It kept me from participating in class, and saying words that commenced with either a w or an r. I would get so frustrated that I eventually made my mother take me to a speech therapist that would eventually help me get rid of it. 

The anxiety and pressure I felt stemmed from my inability to talk like everyone else in my class. People could say world and rabbit with ease while I sat there wondering why I couldn’t. I got made fun of numerous times in my life for it and till this day I sometimes still slip up. As I’ve gotten older I have learned to accept it and not to get frustrated when I don’t properly pronounce a word I may have difficulty with like ‘jewelry’. 

Feeling segregated and out casted really sucks and would never wish it on anyone, people just want to be accepted and loved. When most people get frustrated or anxious it is written all over ther face, either by their body language or facial expressions. My advice to whoever is reading this, is to pay close attention to people and how certain scenarios may affect them. Being empathetic and understanding will be key to diffusing any hostile stereotype threat.
