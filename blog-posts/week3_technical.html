<h3>Why JavaScript? </h3>
<h4>Why it's important relating to Web Design</h4>

<p>
	relating to web design.

First off, JavaScript is an interpreted computer language that allows for user interaction and may be used for game and web development along for application development. 

When designing a website you want the potential viewer to be intrigued by your page, to grasp their attention immediately as their browser loads. A great way to do this is by making your page interactive by using JavaScript. JavaScript allows for your page to engage the visitor, grasp his attention and hold on to it. While making the page engaging is a bonus, you also want it to look professional and overall attractive.  It has the potential to create lively image effects and programmers to integrate a countless number of user plug-ins to help enhance the page as well. 

JavaScript also has the capability to calculate and process data faster, meaning your webpage will load fast and navigate easier due to the bandwidth it helps save. The faster and more responsive a page is the better a chance it has of surviving and reeling in clients. As a general rule of thumb you have around 8 to 15 seconds for a webpage to lose before someone loses interest. If you page takes too long to respond than you will potentially miss out on viewers and or business opportunities. 

One of the things that intrigues me the most is that it is somewhat easy to debug using an application called “Node”. Node allows you to run you’re JavaScript code and go through it step by step to see where the code is producing errors. This can be particularly useful if you are new to JavaScript and would rather not read every line of code until you see something that stands out. Rather node will run the code and then stop once it comes into contact with an error, where it will then tell you where the error is located and the issue with it. Then it is up to to fix it.

These are just a few reasons for why JavaScript is important and should been seen as highly useful tool.
