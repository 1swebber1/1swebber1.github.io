	<h3>The Dev Bootcamp Experience</h3>


<p>The Dev Bootcamp experience, in one word would be; intense. This experience will definitely be built up of a healthy love and hate relationship. With having no preexisting experience in developing and programming I already feel a little behind, but that’s ok because I am ready to catch up.  It will not only be intense but also enjoyable. Teaching yourself through frustration will not only be tough but rewarding and I am ready for all of it. My impression of these next several weeks is long hours, lots of self-inflicted irritation, and plenty of “ Ah Ha” moments. As mush as an introvert that I am, I see myself fitting in with this community very well. I’m all about being a team member and putting gin the hours requested of me. Communication isn’t a great skill of mine but I’m always up for some self-improvement and hopefully with my fellow cohort members will be able to do something amazing together. I wouldn’t say my expectations have changed by much at all. I knew this program would be tough from the beginning and I’ve embraced that what I’m about to start is hard and rigorous, but I’m ready for it. Like most of you, at least I hope, I’m very nervous to start but also excited. I’m sure I’m not alone when I said I have no preexisting experience so hopefully with one another’s help we will all get to where we as a unit desire to be. I look forward to the commencement of our Cohort and I look forward to meeting all of you in person.
