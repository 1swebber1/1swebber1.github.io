<h3>The Art of Asking Questions</h3>


<p>Questions can sometimes be a scary and freightning challenge. Whether it's because you're afraid of sounding dumb or don't know what question to ask, from time to time they bring a lingering sense of uncertainty. But asking questions is a must for any field, especially if one happnes to be a new comer. When I think of asking questions I always refer back to the movie 'Big' with good'ol Tom Hanks. There is a scene in the movie where a toy is being reviwed and discussed. As he sits there he begins to contemplate what makes the toy fun and why is this toy being made. He simply states, 'I don;t get it' and even though it isn't necessarily the most brilliant question he gets everyone in the room thinking, which is what questions should do. Getting people to think, brainstorm and discuss amongst thmesleves it what good questions should always do. ASk questions. Ask questions. Ask questions and if you're not sure about a question ask another. Really the worst that can come of it is that you annoy a few people in the class, but who gives a shit. If it's benefitting you, then there is a huge chance that at least 5 other people in the room had the exact same question or were stuck in a similar area, and guess what, you just helped them out too. Obviously it is crucial to not ask irrelevant questions or to repeat question already asked, but as long as you stay clear of those two mistakes ask away my friend. Ask until there are no more answers left. </p>
