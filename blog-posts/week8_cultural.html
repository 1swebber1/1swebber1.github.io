<h3>Dealing With Conflict</h3>


<p>Conflict comes in various shapes, sizes and forms. It arises physically, emotionally, and mentally. Dealing with conflict is a strong suit that I for one do not have. For the most part, I try to avoid it at any costs and eve though I know that is unhealthy that is what I chose to do up until the last few years of my life. 

An emotional conflict that sticks with me is definitely the one that took place between my parents and I when they split. I didnâ€™t know how to deal with my emotions so I just started to direct hatred towards the two of them for not working it out. I was 17 or so at the time so dealing with those issues was not high on my agenda. It took me about a year or so to start forgiving my parents as they went their separate paths and allowed me to learn from my mistakes of not handling emotional conflicts well. I definitely learned that no matter what one should always keep their cool, it makes shit so much easier. There is no point in being mad at people because life is about more than that and too short for petty shit. I love both my parents dearly and I have move past it and forgive the both of them. (Sorry, I usually like to keep things light and funny but that was one of the only emotional conflicts that came to mind)
