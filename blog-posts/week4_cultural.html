<h3>Problems Facing the Tech World; Over-Reliance</h3>

<p> Have you ever been out with your friends or family and your smart phone dies, or the smart phone of someone around you dies? Are they prepared and have their charger? Do they ask for a charger? Panic because there is no charger near by and they don’t know how to go an hour without checking facebook or seeing how many likes their last instagram picture got? This is a clear example of our generation’s over-reliance on technology. And it’s not just our generation, it has spread, making it’s way from person to person until no one wants to go outside anymore; they’d rather stay indoors and play Call of Duty. 
 
Technology, as a whole, brings a lot of positives to the table. It allows you to connect with people across the world in your living room, to visit foreign countries at your desk, share highly useful information among various interfaces and so on and so forth, the list can almost be endless. But with all these positives on the table it is very easy to overlook the increasing negative impacts it may cause, the number one concern of mine being, over-reliance. 

As technology advances, it becomes more and more complex, allowing you to accomplish objectives never before seen as possible. It becomes easier and easier to distract and entertain yourself at your computer or on your iphone making you less inclined to leave your house or even go outside; hell you can even have your groceries delivered to you now. I can still remember the days when my mom would lock my brothers and I out of the house and tell us we weren’t allowed to come back until we were sweaty. If she didn’t, we’d be inside all day messing around on the computer or playing PlayStation on the fast track to having diabetes by 25. (This isn’t a stab at people with diabetes, my cousin has it; I don’t find it funny. It’s not funny. But, statistically, a major health problem associated with low amounts of physical activity and movement is, diabetes) 

It’s the little things like that that illustrate how easy it has become to be reliant on technology. For example, museums have now become boring. Why visit a museum when you can just look up the desired image of the painting, illustration, video, photograph, place of whatever it is you seek. If the Internet one day just stopped working across the entire world, it would be complete anarchy. 

It is things like which I have listed that frighten me when discussing technology. Yes, technology is amazing in so many ways and very beneficial to our lives. But, if we don’t put it down every once and a while and take a walk or read an actual paperback book I fell as though a large chunk of our culture will be lost and we will end up looking somewhat like the last surviving humans in “Wall-E”.
