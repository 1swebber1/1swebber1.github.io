<h3>Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning</h3>

<p>
	Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning 

When laying out a webpage there are four states of positioning, three of which we will be discussing today; Absolute, Relative, and Fixed. The fourth, Static, is the default layout to almost any web page document. Meaning if you don’t assign a position state, than the content will be positioned as static. 

Let’s dive into one of the easier concepts, absolute positioning.  Absolute positioning tells the browser that any content within the natural flow of the document should be removed and placed exactly where we order it to be. It doesn’t matter if there is content already there. Anything with absolute positioning applied doesn’t affect nor is affected by elements, it will not move. We position an item using the properties top, bottom, left and right in our CSS stylesheet. This can be particularly useful for consistency for example, in the navigation of a web page. 

Relative positioning is similar in the sense that in order for the item to be positioned one must use the properties of top, bottom, left and right. Where absolute positioning on a page is absolute, relative positioning is relative to the position of another element on the page. So let’s say you make a div tag inside of an already established, div tag that has been absolute positioned. If you set the positioning of the new div tag to relative, it will be placed on the page in according to the boundaries set by the first div tag. It can be very useful when you want to tweak positions of certain objects rather than reset them. 


Last but not least, Fixed positioning. Fixed positioning is a lot like absolute however a fixed element never leaves the viewers screen. Meaning even if the user scrolls down, a fixed element will still be in plain site. 

To apply any of these correctly in a stylesheet you must write- 
position; place_state_choice_here,
