<h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h3>

<h4>Exploring Your Values</h4>

<p>In life, when I feel the most satisfied or fortunate values such as accomplishment, enthusiasm, excitement, tranquility and self-respect seem to always be present. The value that I find to be the most pressing and abundant in my life is definitely enthusiasm. For me it’s a way of living life. If you can’t be enthusiastic about a certain activity then for one you aren’t doing it right and two you can’t be completing it whole heartedly. Enthusiasm is a great characteristic to have. It allows for you to get excited about the little accomplishments and leave you even more exhilarated when you surpass a huge milestone.  The end result of enthusiasm allows for one to feel tranquil and accomplished with ones self; which is a great feeling. 
</p>

<h4>Values in Your Life</h4>

<p>In general I attempt to live out these values to the fullest, and although I may be slacking sometimes in a particular area I always manage to come out smiling;
Accomplishment (4)
Enthusiasm (5)
Excitement (4)
Tranquility (3)
Self-Respect (5)
</p>

<h4>Advice</h4>

<p>I’m not too positive on this one but the last time I was asked for input it had to do with a graphic design issue. A fellow peer of mine submitted 5 examples of their work to me and they wanted advice on the project since I had already created mine. I gave them my opinion on each individual piece and then rated them from best to worst. It may seem harsh but when you are creating something generally you benefit from stern honesty rather than someone saying “They All Look Great!”. My honesty was appreciated and they moved forward with the project keeping my critique in mind. </p>

<h4>Values and Stereotype Threat</h4>

<p>I wouldn’t say they I consciously think about the values that are important to me. They are merely guidelines that I try to always follow so that I can feel a sense of self-worth, that I to help in this world and make a few people smile. I will say this, that in order to calm myself and meditate I list off a few recent accomplishments so that I am not to feel overwhelmed, and see that I have not been being lazy and I will then remind myself why I am doing what I am doing. I may not always keep the long term picture in mind, and reminding yourself of your goals and reasons for doing what you are doing always helps me push through the short term issues that seem pressing.  The one exercise that I can think of that will help anyone in a sad or down mood is without a doubt, laughter. Laughter helps everything even if its only a smirk.</p>
