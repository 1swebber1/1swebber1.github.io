<h3>Pairing and Giving</h3>

<p>I feel confident enough to say over the past 5 to 6 weeks I have made considerable progress when it comes to pairing. At first I was a little timid about pairing, I didn’t want to embarrass myself with my lack of knowledge or skill when it comes to coding. So I tried to brush up on it as best I could before I would actually start, after my first group pair I realized this was the wrong way to go about it. I came to the realization that pairing would ultimately be more helpful than struggling through a challenge solo. When I began to pair a little more regularly I found that it was easier from me to learn from others and study how others completed challenges. Even though I have been behind most of phase 0 with the work I have found that pairing has gotten me back up to speed even quicker than I would’ve been able to do myself and to my peers I say thank you. Thank you for being patient and understanding and pushing through challenges with me, even when I seem to be completely lost. 

I’m not going to lie when I first went to go look at the feedback I received I was little nervous. I sometimes get confused during the pair sessions and hold my partner up which is my biggest issue. But to my surprise, for the most part I believe, my peers enjoyed pairing with me; I guess it must be my attitude because my coding skills need work. My approach to the code is usually to make the best of the scenario, not to let my partner get frustrated when we are both stuck and being completely understanding of peoples skills and limitations since I seem to have trouble all the time. 

I have yet to have a poor experience when it comes to pairing. Although it may be, at times, difficult to coordinate a time that works with another individual in need of a pair, it has always benefited me to go out of my way to help fit into others schedules. Let’s keep up the good work and keep collaborating because getting through these next several weeks solo will be quite hard, mentally and physically.
