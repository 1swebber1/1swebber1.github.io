<h3>Classes Vs Modules</h3>

<p>Lets start off by simply defining the two statements above. A class can be defined as “constituent member definer which allows for it’s instance variables to have a state and behavior” A module is defined as simply “a collection of methods and constants”. Now that we have our super intriguing definitions, lets dive in a little deeper. 
</p>

<h4>Classes</h4>

<p>Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, as we’ve all come to learn, which means it manipulates and accesses constructs known as objects. These objects then have methods and attributes (data). A class therefore is way of organizing and creating objects, which act upon alike methods and data. It will contain methods, class variables, and instance variables. 
</p>

<h4>Modules</h4>

<p>Modules and classes are very similar. To begin with a module is used, much like a class, to organize data. While classes are concerned with variables and methods that characterize the class, modules regroup all the information that is deemed as relatable. 
</p>

<p>Since my explanations are a little shitty, for I am still getting comfortable with the difference between the two, I have provided a chart to help clarify the differences between the two.
