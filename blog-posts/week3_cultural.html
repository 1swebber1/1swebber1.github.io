<h3>Concrete Random; The Experimenters of the World</h3>

<p> According to the provided test I have a Gregorc Thinking Style of Concrete Random. Meaning, I enjoy to experiment and work hands on, solving problems creatively without specific guidelines while taking risks to achieve my end result. Relating to Dev Bootcamp, especially during Phase 0, I have found my particular way of learning very helpful and at times very frustrating. A major task so far has been solving complex issues based off of our knowledge on a given subject. This is one are in particular where it has come in handy. Since I like to experiment, I find 2 to 3 different ways to complete a task and see which one is more efficient. Running into an error won’t frustrate me so long as I am still experimenting. The more I experiment, the more I learn from my mistakes and figure out what is working and what is not. I also have the capability to think a little more on the creative side, tackling issues from a different angle that may not have been thought of yet. This can all be good and bad. If I try to solve an issue in a more creative manner and get stuck, I won’t have many guidelines to go off of and could potentially end up messing up the entire project. I also have to tendency to get stuck in an area and not leave it alone until I figure it out.  However in my frustration I am still able to keep my charismatic character and influence others to push, there is no room for negative Nancy’s in my world. 

My biggest struggle has been trying to get into a routine of teaching myself new material and then trying to understand it. Through out the majority of my life I have been taught to do things by others; write, draw, speak French, run, snowboard, swear, golf…etc. This while teaching myself is a new concept and it has definitely taken some getting use to. After three weeks of pushing myself I feel like I am getting better at it everyday and have taught myself to do things that I never thought would be remotely possible without the guidance of a professional.  Another has also been time management. Working a full time job and balancing complex material such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has not been the most fun, although very interesting, not always fun. I have found that pushing through and sitting myself down to complete challenges has become increasingly easier. 

After researching my thinking style it didn’t take long to connect with the negatives that come from being a Concrete Random thinker. For one, explaining how I arrived to a certain solution isn’t necessarily my best skill, which simply won’t fly in Dev Bootcamp. Throughout this process I have become more and more open to talking over different solutions and taking them step by step to clearly illustrate how a certain answer was found. Having an open mind is extremely important, especially when learning material such as this, for without it I would be much more inclined to throw in the towel and ask for a refund; no way in hell that’s happening. Having an growth mindset has helped me push my personal limits and caused me to achieve things I thought were close to impossible.
