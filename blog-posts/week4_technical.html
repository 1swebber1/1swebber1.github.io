<h3>Looping in Ruby</h3>
<h4>What Technically is a Loop?</h4>

<p>When a computer program executes an action it more than likely has to perform said action a number of times, not just once, until a certain condition is met. Therefore a loop simply repeats the action until a condition is met. Ruby has a variety of loops, which consist of  ‘while’, ‘until’, ‘each’ and ‘times’ loops with the more popular being ‘while’ and ‘until’ and the more favored being ‘each’. 
</p>

<h4>While Loops</h4>

<p> A while loop will execute the code so long as the condition that is met is true. It will run until a particular expression is equal to false or until the break command is inserted. While loops are excellent for if you want to execute code until a particular value is reached. The below example illustrates a while loop which is repeated so long as the variable ‘i’ remains less than 20. </p>

<h4>Until Loops</h4>

<p> Until loops are practically identical to ‘while loops’ except for they are the opposite. Meaning an until loop will run the code so long as the condition that is met is false and therefore will end once the condition is equal to true. Using the same example above we’ll replace the while loop with an until loop and see how they are different. </p>

<h4>The Times Loop</h4>

<p>The times loop is fairly different compared to the ‘While’ and ‘Until’ loops. The ‘time’ loop can be used on any variable that is equivalent to a number or on a number itself. In the first example the loop will run 5 times while the second example will run however many times the user tells it to. So for example if the user inputs 20, it will print out the code 20 times. 
</p>

<h4>Each Loops</h4>

<p>I find the ‘each’ loop to the most useful of the four discussed. It will take a variable list and run a statement for each element within the listed variables. In our example there is the variable ‘movie_characters’ which is equal to an array of different character names. The first time the loop runs, the ‘x’ variable will be equivalent to the first character, then when it runs again ‘x’ will be equal to the second character and so on and so forth.
