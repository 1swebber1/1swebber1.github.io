<h3>Computer Memory</h3>

<p>This research hit close to home since I am running out of memory for my laptop and have temporarily misplaced my external hard drive. When it comes to memory I found that most computers have three types of memory storage. It can be via a cache memory, a primary memory source such as the RAM or ROM , or an external memory from a source such as an external hard drive. 
</p>

<h4>Cache Memory</h4>

<p>So from what my understanding cache memory is basically a smaller and faster storage unit that is accessed by your computer’s RAM; it is also expensive my friends. It is categorized in three levels based off the data’s closeness and accessibility to the computers microprocessor. It usually contains the data that is most frequently used by the computer. So what to take way from it is that it is faster than the local hard drive, takes up less access time, stores data temporarily, and it stores programs that are to be executed at a nearing future date. The cons are that it is expensive and has limited space.</p>

<h4>Primary Memory</h4>

<p>Primary memory is divided in to two subcategories of RAM and ROM. RAM is known as Random Access Memory where ROM in known as Read Only Memory. ROM is utilized for more permanent data storage and in most cases the data can only be read, hence read only. It usually stores computer software that needs to be accessed regularly. Primary memory also has the characteristic of volatile memory, meaning that when the power to the computer chip is turned off, the data is lost. So what to take away here is that the primary memory of a computer is the main memory, has volatile memory, faster than secondary memories and that a computer can not run without it. </p>

<h4>Secondary Memory</h4>

<p>Secondary memory, also known as back-up memory, comes from an outside source such as an external hard drive. It is slower than the primary memory source and your computer does not have direct access to it unless plugged-in. It helps share the storage load of a computer and the data is stored permanently. Your computer can function just fine without one unless your memory is almost full in that case you should look into getting one of those bad boys. </p>
